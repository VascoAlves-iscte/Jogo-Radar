Explicação RCS
Radar cross-section (RCS) is a measure of how detectable an object is by radar. 
A larger RCS indicates that an object is more easily detected
An object reflects a limited amount of radar energy back to the source. The factors that influence this include:
    -the material with which the target is made;
    -the absolute size of the target;
    -the incident angle (angle at which the radar beam hits a particular portion of the target, which depends upon the shape of the target and its orientation to the radar source);
    -the reflected angle (angle at which the reflected beam leaves the part of the target hit; it depends upon incident angle);

Explicar stealth:
specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars.
Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft.
